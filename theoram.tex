\begin{theorem}[Pythagoream Theorem]
    In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$).
    \[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $ABC$ be a right-angled triangle with a right angle at $C$. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

    Consider the square constructed on each side of the triangle:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Square on side $AB$ with area $a^2$,
        \item Square on side $BC$ with area $b^2$,
        \item Square on side $AC$ with area $c^2$.
    \end{itemize}

    Now, we observe that the area of the square on side $AC$ is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on sides $AB$ and $BC$, since these squares cover the same area as the square on side $AC$.

    Therefore,
    \[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]
    This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
